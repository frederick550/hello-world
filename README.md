# hello-world
My first attempt at using Git - tutorial <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">here</a>

This line is the result of a commit to a branch named "readme-edits". Soon I will host the code for my CS50 final project on here. Then when that is done I intend to clone the repo into a Google compute cloud instance to put my project on the web. I will then practise my skills adding features to the project whilst maintaining a running site hopefully with minimal downtime.
Should be fun!
